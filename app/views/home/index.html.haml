            %p Huxley needs a knee! (Say that five times fast.) I recently found out my dog, co-pilot, and best friend Huxley has two torn cranial cruciate ligaments, which are the dog equivalent of a human ACL. Veterinary bills are going to add up, and am trying to raise money for these costly procedures.
            %ul.list-2
              %li A typical TTA procedure costs $4400 for one knee
              %li The recovery time is 6 months
              %li Over 95% of dogs go through the procedure complication free
              %li Most dogs will regain full activity after a TTA
              %li Neglecting surgical intervention will dramatically reduce a dog's quality of life and lifespan

                    Me and Huxley fortuitously crossed paths during the winter of 2010. He was six weeks old, born to a loved lab/hound mix in Oroville California. His father, a kind stray, had recently been picked up by animal control, after gaining local lore for allegedly evading the law for over two years.
